what science has to say about &lt;a href=&quot;en/exploring-sleep-and-performance.html&quot;&gt;“Sleep and Human Performance”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each article, we are going to explore one scientific study that sheds light
on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question I have asked myself is “How does lack sleep affect mental
performance?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Turku have written a nice summary on
“Sleep deprivation: Impact on cognitive performance” [1]. One of the studies
they cite was done by the US Military in the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping less than 8 hours reduced the mental performance of the participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even a small reduction to 7 hours of sleep per night already hurt the cognitive performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was even worse when participants slept 5 hours or 3 hours per night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After 7 days of less than 8 hours of sleep, even 3 days of recovery
(8 hrs in bed) was &lt;em&gt;not enough&lt;/em&gt; to bring back the performance
to the level of the people who were not sleep restricted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, researchers of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have studied how sleeping less impacts cognitive function. As one measure for “cognitive function” they used the “Psychomotor vigilance task” where you need to press a button as soon as a light shows up on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They established a baseline by having people stay in bed for 8 hrs for 3 days, and then restricting sleep for 7 days, followed by a 3 day recovery period with again 8 hours sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the sleep restriction period, they had 4 groups with different amounts of time in bed: 9 hours, 7 hours, 5 hours, 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first group that had 9 hours sleep per night: Their performance did not change over the next 7 days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For all other groups, the performance got worse and over the 7 days of sleep restriction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the recovery peroid, only the group that had had 3 hours of sleep “improved” again. But: They were still performing worse then the 5 hour group.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve read this in the context of studying, but also in the context of entrepreneurs who start out with a new idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will summarize Neil Fiore’s book “Overcoming Procrastination: Practice the Now Habit and Guilt-Free Play”. This book is very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/dp/1585425524?ref=nosim&amp;amp;tag=471108152102-21&quot;&gt;his newer book “The Now Habit”&lt;/a&gt;, which might be easier to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can definitely recommend reading this book - it brings a very different
perspective to the problem and shows very practical, implementable ways of
dealing with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niel Fiore’s main hypothesis in this book is that procrastination &lt;strong&gt;is a mechanism
for coping with anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or
decision&lt;/strong&gt;. He explicitly states that his definition is different from the usual
world view of “procrastination is a problem of my personality”, and “I am not
trying hard enough” or “I am not disciplined enough”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 major fear Neil Fiore identifies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fear of being overwhelmed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fear of failure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fear of finishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His approach to dealing with procrastination is based on the goal of helping
the indiviual feeling safe and have positive relationship towards work and
producing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book shows the following levers for approaching procrastination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing your inner dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes to your “work/life balance”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tools to deal with the 3 major fears&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dealing with (inevitable) setbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will pick my personal highlights from the first two categories, which are by no means
complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-changing-your-inner-dialogue&quot;&gt;1) Changing your inner dialogue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you talk to yourself regarding the tasks you are procrastinating on has a
very strong influence on your personal well being and on the likelihood of
yourself working on those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the specific example. Imagine that you have to
“write a book summary”. I invite you to play along and try out how the
statements make you feel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative self talk: “I have to write the book summary”: If I say this to myself,
I feel under pressure, like “I don’t want to, but I have to”. Neil Fiore
explains how this statement has a subtle undercurrent of victimhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggested approach: Remind yourself that you have the choice: You can do the
task - or accept the consequences. In this case: You can either choose to
live with the consequences of not writing the book summary - or you choose to
write it. It’s up to you. Once you have decided you do not live with the
consequences, make sure to use the more exact language of “I choose to written
the book summary”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other negative statements Neil Fiore discusses are “I must finish”, “This is
so big”, “I must be perfect”, “I don’t have time to play”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-change-your-worklife-balance&quot;&gt;2) Change your work/life balance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One “trap” you can fall into is following an “all work, no play” approach.
According to Neil Fiore, this backfires, because it will increase the likelihood
to procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggestes something counter-intuitive: In order to get yourself to work
on the things you want to work on, &lt;em&gt;schedule the ‘play’-activities&lt;/em&gt; first.
This means: When creating your weekly calendar, the first thing you should put
is the things you enjoy doing. And: you have to stick to those committments to
yourself. Work gets scheduled into the remaining time slots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Fiore calls this the “unschedule”, and he illustrates how this idea is based
on the principle of “reverse psychology” and how it makes you sitting down and
doing the work more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said: I can definitely recommend this book. I think it brings deep
insight to the problem and has very implementable advice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Many people struggeling with procrastination have the feeling that it is a character deficit.

&lt;p&gt;Since this person was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, I could say: Yes, totally. I have consumed a lot of self help content, too. And I too got frustrated because I realized: I only translated a very limited amount of the information that I consumed into action. I also had the experience, that I would execute some things for a certain time, but then I quit those things again. The person was also talking about wanting to quit meditation… And I could relate to the meditation example: Been there, done that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently experimenting with the following things (and I am actually quite happy with it currently):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mindset change: Reading Carol Dweck’s “Mindset” was actually an eyeopener for me: Before reading the book, I would have told you: “I sure have a growth mindset.” While reading the book, I realized: That’s not true, because I actually avoid the feeling of “I cannot do it (yet)”. And since this feeling is inherent in any kind of new behavior, it was blocking me from really doing to hard stuff (or expecting it to come easy to me). I’ve tried to counter this by giving myself “permission to suck (at least for a while)”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Habit formation: I try to set up “habits” to automate behavior I want to establish. The “tiny habits” approach was very helpful for me, I written about why in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2scpcrm&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Journaling: I’ve created a “journal template” for myself, basically a set of questions that I answer. The questions remind me of the “tiny habits” I am trying to establish, and they guide me through the thought process I wanted to use to reflect on the last 24 hrs, including what was good and what do I want do do differently in the next 24 hrs. After setting up the tiny habit of sitting down every morning [of each workday], I have been using this template for about 4 weeks now. It’s a lot easier for me to journal this way, because it “guides” me in areas where I have not yet set up the habits that I would like to have.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially the journaling habits is very helpful, because I recently started to ask myself a question from my journal template &lt;strong&gt;automatically&lt;/strong&gt;. Which was an amazing feeling. Because it made me realize: I can change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious if you have been at this place, too - and what has worked for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you feel like you are consuming a lot of self help content without really implementing something on your side, then you can find a littble bit of solace in the fact that you are not alone.

A blogger who wants to grow an email list? And are you asking yourself “Which is the best email list prodiver for me to use”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear you. I’ve been there. My thought process was: I want to build an email list. Everybody successful has one. That’s why I need an email list provider, too. And, logically, I was asking myself “Which is the best email list prodiver for me to use?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I spent time researching the options, ended up testing Mailjet, not being happy with the outcome, researched more options, tested Sendy, not being happy with the fact that it did not let me know if the outbound emails were really sent, tested CleverReach where I was not happy with the fact that they have a Google ReCaptcha in the form. Tried to test Newsletter2Go, where they are still validating my company details at the time of writing, which means I could not even test their functionality as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at my notes on the time it took me, I thing it took me about 10 hrs of work to get where I am now. And my outcome is qualitatively not where I want it to be, so I can choose to invest more time of live with the mediocre status quo. Frustrating. Really frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But: I’ve had an insight: I’ve been asking myself the wrong question. The right question is “Do I REALLY need an email list provider NOW?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my advice to you is: No, my friend, most likely not. I will probably need one. Later. But NOW, it’s very likely not required. I would even argue: It hurts you right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts you, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will take you a lot of time to set the provider up (think 8+ hours)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will most likely not be happy with the result (I was not with mine)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will then frustrate you (I know I was)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which will raise the likelihood of you saying “WTF - this Entrepreneurship-Thing is not for me”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And on top, it takes away a great opportunity: The 1st hand experience of interacting with your potential customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion to you is: Do not use an email list provider. Implement something similar to my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have a signup form sends an email to yourself along the lines “Hi Sebastian, would you please add me to your email list?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the person to an email list in your email client&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write a freshly created email back to the person, thanking them for their interest, and start a conversation with them… Tell them “this is not a robot, it’s a real human”. Ask them what their biggest struggle is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

There was a public
holiday, I was outside of my usual environment because I was travelling with
my family. I did not have a good topic to write about. Many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I am very unhappy about that. I feel bad, because I have not
made any progress. So, what can you do in such a situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way I can think of is derived from horseback riding: If you have fallen
of the horse, you need to get back it.  That’s basically it. Not a long story.
Nothing fancy. Just get back up and write your 100 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should act as your personal horseback riding teacher.
A good teacher will not shame you, because you have fallen of the horse.
He will help you understand why you have fallen off, and he will motivate you
to get back on the horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a better approach anyway: I cannot change the last couple of days, but
I can make sure that today is different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When starting a new habit, you will fail at some point in time.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-knowing-about-habits-helpful&quot;&gt;Why is knowing about habits helpful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to look into habits, because I was struggeling to get myself to do things differently. I had tried the approach to “remind myself to do something”. That worked, but not very reliably: I would remind myself of the behaviour sometimes. But on a lot of days, I realized in the evening that I had forgotten what I wanted to do. And that was very frustrating. And not very effective. And energy consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after reading “&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2J0qAnO&quot;&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/a&gt;” by Charles Duhigg, I realized that there might be a better way: Habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits are basically what the brain uses to conserve (mental) energy. The “autopilot” part of the brain. And for me, this was an awesome value proposition: When I set up the right habit, my brain would remind myself of the desired behaviour all by itself. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-habits-work&quot;&gt;How do habits work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Duhigg explains that the “habit loop” has three major parts: a “cue” (or “trigger”), the behaviour itself, and a reward. Let’s have a quick look at the elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cue/Trigger: This basically the start button for the habit. When our brain recognizes the trigger (after the habit is established), it will then start to execute the behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behaviour: These are the thoughts and actions that the brain executes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward: A positive emotion that signals “hey this was good” to the brain. It is the incentive for our brain to remember the trigger and the behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/the-habit-loop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Habit Loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Habit Loop is one of the core mechanism that our brain has used to learn for thousands of years. It requires no effort. In a nutshell, every time you feel a positive emotion, the brain asks itself: What was the environment like (cue/trigger) before or during the behaviour? What have I done (behaviour) before I felt the positive emotion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the brain tries to figure out: When (cue) and I do (behaviour) then I get (reward). And after it has figured this out, the brain tries to improve the odds of getting the reward: it executes the behaviour when it recognizes the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is: When you harness the power of this mechanism, you can help yourself to execute behaviours that are good for you more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the next post, I’ll go into more details regarding the nuts and bolts of what you have to do to harness the power of Habits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Habits are a basic building block of human behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I have received feedback on my blog posts.  One aspect of the feedback was “I would also like to start publishing, but I do not dare to share my work. You know, I am not as courageous as you are and cannot write such personal things…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which actually left me eyes-wide-open astonished. Not because I had only 3 blog posts with about 600 words in total. But because I do not think that &lt;strong&gt;courage has had anything to do with it.&lt;/strong&gt; And I think: &lt;strong&gt;everyone can do that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come back with me one week and you will hopefully understand why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-warp-one-week-back&quot;&gt;Time warp one week back…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, my inner dialogue was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I start publishing, I want the result to be awesome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;because I do not want other people to think ‘oh, no, not another one of those amateur blogs’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that as a foundation, I would go on to tell myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but I do not really have something awesome to write about - why should somebody else care about my thoughts…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and writing in an awesome way requires that I spend a lot of time and work on it - am I really sure I want to do that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I would think “oh, this is too hard”. It felt like this &lt;strong&gt;HUGE TASK&lt;/strong&gt;. It scared me. I did not think I had a good chance of being successful. And therefore, I did not start to write. And then I felt bad, and because I somehow knew that publishing was important to me and that I did not know how to accomplish my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can believe me when I say that &lt;strong&gt;courageous&lt;/strong&gt; was the last thing I felt at that point in time. Au contraire, mon ami. I felt I did not have courage because I did not do the &lt;strong&gt;scary HUGE TASK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-when-did-i-get-courageous&quot;&gt;So when did I get courageous?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a trick question. Because as I said above, I do not think that courage has had anything to do with it. I did not need courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else was needed: The decision to shrink the &lt;strong&gt;scary HUGE TASK&lt;/strong&gt; into the &lt;strong&gt;easily doable thing&lt;/strong&gt;. I was able to change the success criteria in such a way that I was very confident I could achieve my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I remember how thought: Well, that’s easy - I can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-how-did-i-do-it&quot;&gt;And how did I do it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it started with giving myself the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha&quot;&gt;permission to suck&lt;/a&gt;”. And it helped that I defined success as publishing only 100 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now my inner dialogue looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most important thing is that I publish at least 100 words every workday&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I try my best to make those 100 words helpful to at least one person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I try to help by showing where I struggled and how I could make progress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I celebrate after publishing my 100+ words - because that’s the thing only I can control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new thought process puts me in the driver seat. I am in control to write 100 words and publish them. And I know when I tried to help one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy now to feel successful. I mean, 100 words, come on, that’s basically a short email. And It can even be a sucky email. Why would I need courage for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;everyone-can-do-that&quot;&gt;Everyone can do that&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that everybody can go from “the person that does not have the courage to publish” to “the person who thinks publishing is easy’ in a very short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it took only a couple of hours work and 3 blog posts with about 600 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic trick is: Make your objective smaller. So small you do not need courage any more. That’s how you can get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation: Set up a new habit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every time you think&lt;/strong&gt; “I am afraid, I need more courage”,&lt;br /&gt;
stop yourself, and think  &lt;strong&gt;“Easy eats Courage for Breakfast”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and ask yourself &lt;strong&gt;“What could be an easy step that takes me into this direction?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to believe your own experience. Try this for a couple of days - and let me know how it works for you via Twitter or any other way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Waiting for courage in order to start can keep you waiting forever.

&lt;p&gt;In my last posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha&quot;&gt;habit formation&lt;/a&gt;, I have mentioned the Stanford University psychologist BJ Fogg. Another gold nugget I have gotten from him is his suggestion for an early morning habit that can lay the foundation for an awesome day. He calls it the MauiHabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is to create the following habit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; I get out of my bed, and &lt;strong&gt;my feet touch the ground,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I will &lt;strong&gt;say to myself ‘Today is going to be an awesome day’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I can understand if you think “Really? That’s it?”. I would have thought the same. But: I have tried his suggestion for the last couple of days: I was easy to do, it has put a smile on my face. That for itself could be enough, but on top of that, I have had a couple of awesome days this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to believe your own experience. Try this for a couple of days - and let me know how it works for you via Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In my last posts on habit formation, I have mentioned the Stanford University psychologist BJ Fogg.

&lt;p&gt;In meinen letzten Post zum Thema &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha&quot;&gt;“Gewohnheiten”&lt;/a&gt; habe ich den Psychologen BJ Fogg von der Uni Stanford erwähnt. Ein Geheimtipp, den ich aus einem seiner Videos habe, ist sein Vorschlag für eine Gewohnheit direkt nach dem Aufstehen. BJ Fogg nennt es die “Maui-Gewohnheit”, benannt nach einer der Insel des Archipels Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJ Foggs Vorschlag ist, die als nächstes beschriebene Gewohnheit aufzubauen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wenn ich morgens aufstehe und meine Füße das erste Mal den Boden berühren,&lt;br /&gt;
dann sage ich zu mir selbst: Heute wird ein toller Tag.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ja, ich kann es verstehen, wenn du jetzt denkst “Wirklich? Das ist alles?”. Ich hätte das Gleiche gedacht. Nur: Ich habe seinen Vorschlag in den letzten Tagen ausprobiert - und es hat jedesmal ein Lächeln auf mein Gesicht gezaubert. Das alleine würde eigentlich schon reichen. Aber zustäzlich waren die Tage dann tatsächlich toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laut BJ Fogg kann bereits diese kleine Veränderung einen großen Einfluß auf den Tag haben. Er berichtet von Menschen, für die das der erste “Dominostein” geworden ist, weil bereits der kleine Impuls gereicht hat, um danach weitere Dinge zu machen, die positiven Einfluß auf den Tag haben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich erwarte auch nicht, dass Du mir glaubst. Im Gegenteil. Eigentlich solltest Du mir nicht glauben. Du solltest nur Deine eigenen Erfahrungen glauben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daher mein Tipp: Probier es für ein paar Tage aus - und lassen mich wissen, wie es für Dich funktioniert hat…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Wenn Du wissen willst, wie Du morgens in 5 Sekunden die Grundlage für einen tollen Tag legen kannst, dann solltest Du diesen Artikel lesen...</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://blog.happy-and-productive.com/images/maui2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">100 words on … making habit formation more successful</title><link href="http://blog.happy-and-productive.com/making-habit-formation-more-successful" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100 words on … making habit formation more successful" /><published>2018-05-24T03:42:39-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-24T03:42:39-05:00</updated><id>http://blog.happy-and-productive.com/100-words-on-raising-the-bar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.happy-and-productive.com/making-habit-formation-more-successful">&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I was talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha&quot;&gt;making it easy to start&lt;/a&gt;: By making it so simple you cannot fail — and giving yourself permission to suck because it is highly likely that you will do so in the beginning. For me, the bar is currently: Publish 100 words every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feedback I have received was: “Great, now that you have done 100 words — set the bar to 200 tomorrow.” But I am not going to raise the bar. At least not for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is based on BJ Foggs recommendation: &lt;strong&gt;“Easy” is key for establishing new habits&lt;/strong&gt;. Part of my objective is to set up a habit where I do this regularly. And to establish a behavior as a habit, it is necessary to do the behavior in the first place — and then be able to feel a sense of accomplishment after I have done the desired behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about publishing 100 words now, I immediately get the feeling: I can do this. That’s easy. Which actually makes me want to do the publishing, because I know I will feel great afterwards. On the other hand, if I would raise the bar, I felt myself unsure if I reach my goal — and as a consequence I was not as motivated to get started in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I will keep the bar at 100 words for now. And maybe raise the bar when I get to the point where I think “100 words is too boring”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be interested if you have made a similar experience. Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the last post, I was talking about making it easy to start: By making it so simple you cannot fail — and giving yourself permission to suck because it is highly likely that you will do so in the beginning.
