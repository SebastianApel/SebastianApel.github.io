    <p>I have been struggling with my objective to start publishing content on the Internet now for a while. I’ve tried a lot of things: Setting up habits to write every morning, reading a lot on how to do things. But in the end, I have not been able to establish something regular, much less publish ANYTHING.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I have listened to a <a href="http://bit.ly/il-2a1UYb0">podcast with BJ Fogg and David Kadavy</a>: They were talking about how to make it <strong>simple enough</strong> to just do it. And David said that he gave himself <strong>permission to suck</strong>. So, I am resetting my bar to just publish 100 words for now. Without any wanting it to be great, awesome, new, innovative, value-adding. Just starting.</p>

<p><strong>Because it is the only way to learn and get better.</strong></p>
