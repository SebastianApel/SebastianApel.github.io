            Why Your Todo-List Makes You Unhappy &amp; Frustrated (and What To Do About It)

        </h3>Conventional wisdom puts the Todo-List on a pedestal. I have done so, too - for a long time.

        </h3>I am deeply thankful for Tom Bilyeu and his show Impact Theory. But I also think that Tom Bilyeu falls short in accomplishing the mission he has set out to do. He is not solving the problem he wants to solve. It does not help people to achieve what they want to achieve - it just dangles the carrot in front of people's face without telling people how to get it.</li><li><span class="is-size-7 has-text-grey post-meta">Jul 4, 2018</span>
