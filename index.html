            Getting back on the horse
          </a>
        </h3>When starting a new habit, you will fail at some point in time. The question is: what are you going to do about it? Are you going to shame yourself? Or are you helping yourself to get back onto the horse?</li><li><span class="post-meta">May 29, 2018</span>

            How to Build Great Habits (pt 1)
          </a>
        </h3>Habits are a basic building block of human behaviour. If you want to change your behaviour, then understanding habits is one of the best investments you can make. Read the post to get the 3 minute management summary.</li><li><span class="post-meta">May 28, 2018</span>

            Easy eats Courage for Breakfast
          </a>
        </h3>Waiting for courage in order to start can keep you waiting forever. Because courage does not come before doing. And it's faulty thinking that courage is required. Something else does the trick: making things easy. </li><li><span class="post-meta">May 25, 2018</span>

            How to Lay the Foundation for an Awesome Day
          </a>
        </h3>In my last posts on habit formation, I have mentioned the Stanford University psychologist BJ Fogg. Another gold nugget I have gotten from him is his suggestion for an early morning habit that can lay the foundation for an awesome day. He calls it the MauiHabit.</li><li><span class="post-meta">May 24, 2018</span>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In the last post, I was talking about <a href="http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha">making it easy to start</a>: By making it so simple you cannot fail — and giving yourself permission to suck because it is highly likely that you will do so in the beginning. For me, the bar is currently: Publish 100 words every day.</p>

        </h3><p>I have been struggling with my objective to start publishing content on the Internet now for a while. I’ve tried a lot of things: Setting up habits to write every morning, reading a lot on how to do things. But in the end, I have not been able to establish something regular, much less publish ANYTHING.</p>
