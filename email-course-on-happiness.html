            Are you struggeling to be happier?
            Do you feel everybody else has more fun than you?
            If so, this <strong>free 5 day email course</strong> explains (in detail)
            how I've increased my own happiness using these powerful tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            My name is Sebastian Apel, and I guess you could say I'm a jack-of-all-trades.
            I'm a programmer, consultant, and now an expert on happiness.
            When I looked at my life over 2 years ago, I had to (re)-learn how to see the beauty
            in my life (through a lot of trial and error), and I wish I had had the information
            that I have now.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the first time publicly, <strong>I've outlined — start-to-finish — the
              strategy I've taken to improve my happiness.</strong>
              Over the last years, I've read at least 10 books on the subject.
              You can learn more about me and what I learned and tried here, but enter your email address and
              I'll send you the first email of a five day mini-course I've put together
              on increasing your happiness using simple and easy implementable actions:
