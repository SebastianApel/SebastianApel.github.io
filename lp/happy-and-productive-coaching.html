<p>Mine stresses me. At least it did in the past. Here are a couple of observations, thoughts and feelings I have had around this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When I look at that looong list, I think “I’ll never be able to do everything I SHOULD be doing, or that I WOULD LIKE to do” - and I get frustrated and scared</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day, I am thinking “OMG, so little progress - why didn’t you accomplish more today” - not something I want in the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, alternatively, I look at my watch and think “OMG, where has the time gone?” and get frustrated, because it feels like I have “wasted” precious time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another oldie-but-goodie is spoiling a perfectly productive day when the random thought about another project pops up - and I think “Oh sh*t, I wanted to work on that, too”…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, I have too much stuff I WANT to do, and NOT ENOUGH TIME to do it.</p>

<h3 id="this-will-never-change---and-you-need-to-deal-with-it">This will never change - and you need to deal with it…</h3>

<p>One major insight I had was: THAT will never change. I will always have more
stuff I want to do than time doing it. So I better find a way to deal with
that situation effectively.</p>

<p>And because of this, I am working on a framework &amp; system to train myself to a different approach.</p>

<h3 id="wouldnt-it-be-awesome-to-be-able-to-relax-because-you-can-trust-the-system">Wouldn’t it be awesome to be able to relax, because you can trust the system?</h3>

<p>My dream is to have a framework &amp; system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that helps me think about all areas of my life</li>
  <li>helps me make conscious decisions where I want to allocate my time</li>
  <li>and in that time helps me to prioritize on the work that makes the biggest change in my life</li>
  <li>so that, at the end of the day, I can be sure I made the best use of my short time on this planet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-have-made-great-progress-regarding-such-a-system">I have made great progress regarding such a system</h3>

<p>Because I like the vision, I have decided to make use of all that stuff I have read about Positive Psychology, Habit Formation, Design Methods, Agile Software Development (and of course my altMBA nuggets) - and work to create such a framework &amp; system.</p>

<p>I am currently using “Version 1.0”, and I find it very helpful.</p>

<h3 id="the-hard-work-is-changing-your-own-behaviour">The hard work is changing your own behaviour</h3>

<p>One of the major insights I have had during the development is:</p>

<p><strong>Changing your own beliefs and behaviour is the hardest part.</strong></p>

<p>Some people can do that alone. Most of the content I am going to use is
available on the internet. Or in my blog. No rocket science.</p>

<p>So, if you prefer to learn on your own, then I hope I have compiled a lot of
helpful information and links on my blog.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-for-people-who-want-to-accellerate-their-progress">This is for people who want to accellerate their progress</h3>

<p>For all the people who want to <strong>accellerate their progress</strong>, I am working
on a special offer: <strong>A 4 week group coaching program that helps you
to make the change you are seeking in your life.</strong></p>

<p>The vision for the program is to build a place where</p>
<ul>
  <li>you will get a roadmap that helps you stack <strong>small victories</strong></li>
  <li>you will find the structure that helps you succeed and <strong>gets you back on
track</strong> when you slip</li>
  <li>you <strong>meet people who want to make the same change</strong> that you want to make,
because being in a group makes it easier</li>
</ul>

<p>I will start the first “private beta” for the coaching programm soon.</p>

<h3 id="only-five-seats-for-the-first-private-beta">Only five seats for the first “private beta”</h3>

<p>I will only take 5 people into the first “private beta”. The reason
I am doing this is to make sure that everyone get’s the most value out of the
program.</p>

<p>Later, there will be more people in the groups. So, if you want early
access to the course, and increased coaching from my side, then make
sure to apply to the waiting list below.</p>
