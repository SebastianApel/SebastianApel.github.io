<p>Mine stresses me. At least it did in the past. Here are a couple of observations, thoughts and feelings I have had around this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When I look at that looong list, I think “I’ll never be able to do everything I SHOULD be doing, or that I WOULD LIKE to do” - and I get frustrated and scared</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day, I am thinking “OMG, so little progress - why didn’t you accomplish more today” - not something I want in the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, alternatively, I look at my watch and think “OMG, where has the time gone?” and get frustrated, because it feels like I have “wasted” precious time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another oldie-but-goodie is spoiling a perfectly productive day when the random thought about another project pops up - and I think “Oh sh*t, I wanted to work on that, too”…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, I have too much stuff I WANT to do, and NOT ENOUGH TIME to do it.</p>

<h3 id="this-will-never-change---and-you-need-to-deal-with-it">This will never change - and you need to deal with it…</h3>

<p>One major insight I had was: THAT will never change. I will always have more
stuff I want to do than time doing it. So I better find a way to deal with
that situation effectively.</p>

<p>And because of this, I am working on a framework &amp; system to train myself to a different approach.</p>

<h3 id="wouldnt-it-be-awesome-to-be-able-to-relax">Wouldn’t it be awesome to be able to relax?</h3>

<p>Wouldn’t it be awesome to have a framework &amp; system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that helps you think about all areas of my life</li>
  <li>helps you make conscious decisions where I want to allocate my time</li>
  <li>and in that time helps you to prioritize on the work that has the biggist impact in you life</li>
  <li>so that, at the end of the day, you can be sure you made the best use of your short time on this planet?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="join-the-webinar-to-learn-more">Join the webinar to learn more!</h3>

<p>In the webinar, we will answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insights from modern science: What you need to do to be happy &amp; productive?</li>
  <li>Why does the classical “Todo-List”-approach fail (given those insights)?</li>
  <li>What do those insights mean for the development of a better approach?</li>
  <li>What does an alternative approach look like?</li>
</ul>

<p>After the webinar, you</p>
<ul>
  <li>have a better understanding why your current approach stresses you</li>
  <li>know what a better approach looks like</li>
  <li>have a set of tools &amp; templates that will enable you to get started today</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="who-should-not-join-the-webinar">Who should not join the webinar</h3>

<p>We have designed the webinar very specifically for a certain group of people:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you want fast results, you should join the webinar:</strong> Most of the
  information in our webinar is available in books or on the internet. So, if
  you prefer
  to read the books we recommend on your own, please let us know, we are more
  than happy to give recommendations on what to read. The webinar, however,
  is for people who do NOT want to spend 20+ hours of their life reading.
  The webinar is for people who want direct results with a smaller time
  investment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-does-it-cost">What does it cost?</h3>

<p>We are offering the webinar for 79,- Euros (plus VAT, depending on your country
	of residence and the question if you are buying for your company or not).</p>
