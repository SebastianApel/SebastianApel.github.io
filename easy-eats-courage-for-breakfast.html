<p>Yesterday, I have received feedback on my blog posts.  One aspect of the feedback was “I would also like to start publishing, but I do not dare to share my work. You know, I am not as courageous as you are and cannot write such personal things…”</p>

<p>Which actually left me eyes-wide-open astonished. Not because I had only 3 blog posts with about 600 words in total. But because I do not think that <strong>courage has had anything to do with it.</strong> And I think: <strong>everyone can do that.</strong></p>

<p>Come back with me one week and you will hopefully understand why:</p>

<h3 id="time-warp-one-week-back">Time warp one week back…</h3>

<p>About a week ago, my inner dialogue was something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I start publishing, I want the result to be awesome</li>
  <li>because I do not want other people to think ‘oh, no, not another one of those amateur blogs’</li>
</ul>

<p>With that as a foundation, I would go on to tell myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>but I do not really have something awesome to write about - why should somebody else care about my thoughts…</li>
  <li>and writing in an awesome way requires that I spend a lot of time and work on it - am I really sure I want to do that?</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, I would think “oh, this is too hard”. It felt like this <strong>HUGE TASK</strong>. It scared me. I did not think I had a good chance of being successful. And therefore, I did not start to write. And then I felt bad, and because I somehow knew that publishing was important to me and that I did not know how to accomplish my goal.</p>

<p>You can believe me when I say that <strong>courageous</strong> was the last thing I felt at that point in time. Au contraire, mon ami. I felt I did not have courage because I did not do the <strong>scary HUGE TASK</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="so-when-did-i-get-courageous">So when did I get courageous?</h3>

<p>That’s a trick question. Because as I said above, I do not think that courage has had anything to do with it. I did not need courage.</p>

<p>Something else was needed: The decision to shrink the <strong>scary HUGE TASK</strong> into the <strong>easily doable thing</strong>. I was able to change the success criteria in such a way that I was very confident I could achieve my goal.</p>

<p>Actually I remember how thought: Well, that’s easy - I can do this.</p>

<h3 id="and-how-did-i-do-it">And how did I do it?</h3>

<p>I think it started with giving myself the “<a href="http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha">permission to suck</a>”. And it helped that I defined success as publishing only 100 words.</p>

<p>And now my inner dialogue looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The most important thing is that I publish at least 100 words every workday</li>
  <li>I try my best to make those 100 words helpful to at least one person</li>
  <li>I try to help by showing where I struggled and how I could make progress</li>
  <li>I celebrate after publishing my 100+ words - because that’s the thing only I can control.</li>
</ol>

<p>This new thought process puts me in the driver seat. I am in control to write 100 words and publish them. And I know when I tried to help one person.</p>

<p>It is easy now to feel successful. I mean, 100 words, come on, that’s basically a short email. And It can even be a sucky email. Why would I need courage for that?</p>

<h3 id="everyone-can-do-that">Everyone can do that</h3>

<p>I believe that everybody can go from “the person that does not have the courage to publish” to “the person who thinks publishing is easy’ in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>For me, it took only a couple of hours work and 3 blog posts with about 600 words.</p>

<p>The magic trick is: Make your objective smaller. So small you do not need courage any more. That’s how you can get started.</p>

<p>My recommendation: Set up a new habit:</p>

<p><strong>Every time you think</strong> “I am afraid, I need more courage”,<br />
stop yourself, and think  <strong>“Easy eats Courage for Breakfast”</strong><br />
and ask yourself <strong>“What could be an easy step that takes me into this direction?”</strong></p>

<p>Again, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to believe your own experience. Try this for a couple of days - and let me know how it works for you via Twitter or any other way.</p>
