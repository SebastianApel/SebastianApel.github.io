  <div class="content has-text-black post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A question that I have read a lot is “How can I get disciplined and start doing what I have planned?”. I’ve read this in the context of studying, but also in the context of entrepreneurs who start out with a new idea.</p>

<p>In this article, I will summarize Neil Fiore’s book “Overcoming Procrastination: Practice the Now Habit and Guilt-Free Play”. This book is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.de/dp/1585425524?ref=nosim&amp;tag=471108152102-21">his newer book “The Now Habit”</a>, which might be easier to obtain.</p>

<p>I can definitely recommend reading this book - it brings a very different
perspective to the problem and shows very practical, implementable ways of
dealing with the problem.</p>

<p>Niel Fiore’s main hypothesis in this book is that procrastination <strong>is a mechanism
for coping with anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or
decision</strong>. He explicitly states that his definition is different from the usual
world view of “procrastination is a problem of my personality”, and “I am not
trying hard enough” or “I am not disciplined enough”.</p>

<p>The 3 major fear Neil Fiore identifies are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The fear of being overwhelmed</li>
  <li>The fear of failure</li>
  <li>The fear of finishing</li>
</ul>

<p>His approach to dealing with procrastination is based on the goal of helping
the indiviual feeling safe and have positive relationship towards work and
producing.</p>

<p>The book shows the following levers for approaching procrastination:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changing your inner dialogue</li>
  <li>Changes to your “work/life balance”</li>
  <li>Tools to deal with the 3 major fears</li>
  <li>Dealing with (inevitable) setbacks</li>
</ol>

<p>I will pick my personal highlights from the first two categories, which are by no means
complete:</p>

<h1 id="1-changing-your-inner-dialogue">1) Changing your inner dialogue</h1>

<p>How you talk to yourself regarding the tasks you are procrastinating on has a
very strong influence on your personal well being and on the likelihood of
yourself working on those tasks.</p>

<p>Let’s take the specific example. Imagine that you have to
“write a book summary”. I invite you to play along and try out how the
statements make you feel:</p>

<p>Negative self talk: “I have to write the book summary”: If I say this to myself,
I feel under pressure, like “I don’t want to, but I have to”. Neil Fiore
explains how this statement has a subtle undercurrent of victimhood.</p>

<p>Suggested approach: Remind yourself that you have the choice: You can do the
task - or accept the consequences. In this case: You can either choose to
live with the consequences of not writing the book summary - or you choose to
write it. It’s up to you. Once you have decided you do not live with the
consequences, make sure to use the more exact language of “I choose to written
the book summary”.</p>

<p>The other negative statements Neil Fiore discusses are “I must finish”, “This is
so big”, “I must be perfect”, “I don’t have time to play”.</p>

<h1 id="2-change-your-worklife-balance">2) Change your work/life balance</h1>

<p>One “trap” you can fall into is following an “all work, no play” approach.
According to Neil Fiore, this backfires, because it will increase the likelihood
to procrastinate.</p>

<p>He suggestes something counter-intuitive: In order to get yourself to work
on the things you want to work on, <em>schedule the ‘play’-activities</em> first.
This means: When creating your weekly calendar, the first thing you should put
is the things you enjoy doing. And: you have to stick to those committments to
yourself. Work gets scheduled into the remaining time slots.</p>

<p>Neil Fiore calls this the “unschedule”, and he illustrates how this idea is based
on the principle of “reverse psychology” and how it makes you sitting down and
doing the work more likely.</p>

<p>As I said: I can definitely recommend this book. I think it brings deep
insight to the problem and has very implementable advice.</p>
