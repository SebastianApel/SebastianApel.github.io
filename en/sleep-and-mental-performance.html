  <div class="content has-text-black post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is going to be one of several articles in which I am going to explore
what science has to say about <a href="en/exploring-sleep-and-performance.html">“Sleep and Human Performance”</a></p>

<p>In each article, we are going to explore one scientific study that sheds light
on the subject.</p>

<p>The first question I have asked myself is “How does lack of sleep affect mental
performance?”.</p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Turku have written a nice summary on
“Sleep deprivation: Impact on cognitive performance” [1]. One of the studies
they cite was done by the US Military in the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research [2].</p>

<p>The “too long, did not read” summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sleeping less than 8 hours reduced the mental performance of the participants</li>
  <li>Even a small reduction to 7 hours of sleep per night already hurt the cognitive performance</li>
  <li>It was even worse when participants slept 5 hours or 3 hours per night</li>
  <li>After 7 days of less than 8 hours of sleep, even 3 days of recovery
(8 hrs in bed) was <em>not enough</em> to bring back the performance
to the level of the people who were not sleep restricted</li>
</ul>

<p>Long version:</p>

<p>In 2003, researchers of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have studied how sleeping less impacts cognitive function. As one measure for “cognitive function” they used the “Psychomotor vigilance task” where you need to press a button as soon as a light shows up on a screen.</p>

<p>They established a baseline by having people stay in bed for 8 hrs for 3 days, and then restricting sleep for 7 days, followed by a 3 day recovery period with again 8 hours sleep.</p>

<p>During the sleep restriction period, they had 4 groups with different amounts of time in bed: 9 hours, 7 hours, 5 hours, 3 hours.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first group that had 9 hours sleep per night: Their performance did not change over the next 7 days.</li>
  <li>For all other groups, the performance got worse and over the 7 days of sleep restriction.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the recovery peroid, only the group that had had 3 hours of sleep “improved” again. But: They were still performing worse then the 5 hour group.</p>
