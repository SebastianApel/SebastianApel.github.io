<p>I like to try things. When I read about Dave Asprey’s Bulletproof Coffee, it sounded awesome: “Boost your Energy and Brain Function”, “Suppress Hunger, Loose Weight, Think Faster…”. Man, who would not want that?</p>

<p>Since I am a curious guy, I’ve tried it for about 6 weeks during the weekdays. I definitely had some of the benefits: I was not hungry until lunch, I could concentrate in the mornings.</p>

<p>But not all things worked as advertised: I did not loose weight, au contraire, I gained some weight. And, after a while, I started to feel worse and worse. Tired in the afternoons. A little nauseas.</p>

<p>So, I asked myself: what’s wrong here? I started thinking and reseaching a bit - and you find my results below.</p>

<p>But before that, let’s have a quick look at the reciepe again:</p>

<p>Bulletproof Coffee <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/">consists of the following ingredients</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>1-2 tablespoons of Unsalted Butter</li>
  <li>1-2 tablespoons of MCT Oil</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weight-reduction">Weight Reduction</h3>

<p>Let’s have a look at weight reduction first:</p>

<p>your Bulletproof Coffee will be high caloric, because of the high fat content:
if you stick to the 1 tablespoon for butter &amp; oil, that’s about 230 kcal.
If you use 2 tablespoons for both, that’s 460 kcal.</p>

<p>A sedentary person “burns” about 2000 kcal per day. If you want to loose weight,
you need to be below that. There’s the rule of thumb, that you need to have
a 500 kcal daily caloric deficit to loose 1lb of body fat in a week <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/calories-in-a-pound-of-fat">(although
	people also say that’s not true)</a></p>

<p>But for our example, let’s stick to that and assume a 1500 kcal per day “target”.
This means, after your bulletproof coffee, you have used 15-30% of your daily
caloric “allowance” right after you finished drinking.</p>

<h3 id="nutrient-intake">Nutrient Intake</h3>

<p>The other observation is: with those calories, you have not had ANY vitamins,
ANY minerals, and no protein. This is similar for soft drinks - only that
those calories are called “empty calories” in the case for soft drinks.</p>

<p>And even the marketing is similar: one famous soft drink was announced as
<a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/the-first-ad-for-cocacola">“Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilirating! Invigorating!”</a>
in it’s first ad.</p>

<p>But back to nutrient intake: in order to get all the nutrients you need,
this means you have to get the nutrients from the rest of your meals that day.
Which is already hard enough without replacing one whole meal with empty calories.</p>

<p>For fun, let’s have a look at Potassium intake. Potassium is present in all
body tissues and is required for normal cell function. It is an essential
nutrient, because the body cannot produce it itself.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK132453/">recommends 3510 mg/day of Potassium for adults [1].</a>
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine even <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/">recommends 4700 mg/day [2].</a></p>

<p>But: this recommendation is already not reached, according to
the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/">National Insititutes of Health [2]</a>. They cite studies that suggest that the average potassium intake from foods
are around 3000mg of Potassium for males and 2300mg for females.</p>

<p>Now imagine what leaving out a whole meal means for your (probably already too
low) Potassium intake.</p>

<p>My personal guess for myself is: I have not been been consuming more. Because
if you have a look at the symptoms of mild potassium deficiency (hypokalemia),
you will find: “Mild hypokalemia is characterized by constipation,
fatigue, muscle weakness, and malaise [2]”. Which describes how I felt pretty
well.</p>

<h3 id="my-personal-consequences">My personal consequences</h3>

<p>From those observations, my conclusions were pretty straight forward:
it’s probably a better idea to have healthy <em>food</em> for breakfast and
use that meal to get the nutrients my body needs.
And this is what I have returned to.</p>
