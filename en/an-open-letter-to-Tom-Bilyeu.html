  <div class="content has-text-black post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Tom Bilyeu,</p>

<p>Let me first say: Thank you for your show. This morning, I’ve literally had tears in my eyes because
I felt deeply thankful for the ideas that I encounter in your show. I am thankful, because you give me an
opportunity to glimpse into great minds that I otherwise don’t have access to.</p>

<p>This morning, it was the interview with Naveen Jain and his thoughts on profits that were very
insightful. When I listened to the “After Impact” you were talking about the fact that it find the following fact “so distressing” (starting around 24:15) about “making people thirsty”.</p>

<p>You explicitely “I am not making people thirsty. But if you are thirsty, come to me, I have a solution for you.”</p>

<p>Let me be very clear and frank: Tom Bilyeu, you currently DO NOT HAVE a solution. Or, if you have one, you are failing miserably at teaching or showing that solution. If your mission is to help people CHANGE their mindset, then you are falling short. Way short. I would even contradict your statement and say: Currently, ALL you do is making people thirsty.</p>

<p>I’ll go even further and say: you leave them thirsty, very similar to many speakers in the “mindset” arena (like Tony Robbins and others). Your “solution” currently is like a soft drink: you only get more thirsty by drinking the stuff…</p>

<p>Let me give you my perspective:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can you expect that passively “consuming” a 1hr show changes people deeply enough that they “go on and read 100 books?”  If “mindset change” was as easy as watching or reading “information about other people’s beliefs”, then we would have A LOT MORE billionaires out there. So, you need to “DO THE WORK”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am ready to do the work. In fact, that’s incorrect. I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME KIND OF WORK FOR YEARS. For years and years I’ve worked on changing my trajectory towards Entrepreneurship, Happiness and Health in my life. Basically since I encountered Tony Robbins in 2004.  I’ve got bookshelves full of books on the topic. I’ve read them. I listen to podcasts. Daily. I watch the Youtube channels. Daily. And it’s DEEPLY frustrating to see that my progress is slow, painfully slow. And let me assure you: It’s not because I haven’t worked hard. For years, I’ve slept 6hrs or less. I’ve worked 9-11pm. It’s not because I am not intellectually curious - I am. I don’t have a freakin televison. I rarely read the news any more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t hear the freakin “Work till you drop” advice any more. The research on is abundantly clear: If you neglect sleep, you HURT YOURSELF. Not enough sleep makes people dumb, fat, unhappy and dead.  So I’ve promised myself to get enough sleep from now on. I have a family which I am grateful for. To be honest: My family is I am most grateful for in my life. For years, I’ve prioritized work over my family. I’ve stopped doing that, because it just does not make sense to me any more: If I don’t spend time with my children - how are they supposed to be inspired by me? How am I supposed to help them develop a great mindset? How are my children supposed to develop a feeling of “I am important” if the implicit message they are getting all the freaking time is “Something else (work, self improvement) is more important than you are”?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My problems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s the RIGHT work I need to do?</li>
  <li>How do I identify the LIMITING BELIEFS in my mindset?</li>
  <li>How do I replace the LIMITING BELIEF with a BETTER BELIEF?</li>
  <li>What should I TRAIN on a daily basis?</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me use a metaphor to describe what I am thinking:</p>

<p>Currently you are saying “I don’t get it - I’ve shown people videos about great Triathletes
who are killing it in the Ironman competition. I can see how fired up they are. With those triathletes,
I talk about how they think about Triathlon, and how they mentally manage the challeges. We talk what those Athletes THINK when their muscles hurt after swimming and cycling. But people are just not executing against that…”</p>

<p>Yes, that’s because the audience has tried to adopt the MINDSET and they have realized that they still are not a top athlete.</p>

<p>Tom, I need a “training plan”. I need somebody to tell me: In week 1, train swimming on Monday and Thursdays, running on Tuesdays, cycling on Saturdays. Take the other days off, because your body needs to recover. In week 2 do this. In week 3, do that.</p>

<p>That might be a SOLUTION that works for me. Otherwise, all the content is just like soft drinks: They make me more thirsty.</p>
