  <div class="content has-text-black post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the last post, I was talking about <a href="http://bit.ly/2GJv0ha">making it easy to start</a>: By making it so simple you cannot fail — and giving yourself permission to suck because it is highly likely that you will do so in the beginning. For me, the bar is currently: Publish 100 words every day.</p>

<p>One feedback I have received was: “Great, now that you have done 100 words — set the bar to 200 tomorrow.” But I am not going to raise the bar. At least not for a while.</p>

<p>The reason for this is based on BJ Foggs recommendation: <strong>“Easy” is key for establishing new habits</strong>. Part of my objective is to set up a habit where I do this regularly. And to establish a behavior as a habit, it is necessary to do the behavior in the first place — and then be able to feel a sense of accomplishment after I have done the desired behavior.</p>

<p>When I think about publishing 100 words now, I immediately get the feeling: I can do this. That’s easy. Which actually makes me want to do the publishing, because I know I will feel great afterwards. On the other hand, if I would raise the bar, I felt myself unsure if I reach my goal — and as a consequence I was not as motivated to get started in the first place.</p>

<p>This is why I will keep the bar at 100 words for now. And maybe raise the bar when I get to the point where I think “100 words is too boring”.</p>

<p>I’d be interested if you have made a similar experience. Let me know!</p>
