<h3 id="management-summary">Management Summary</h3>

<p>The “Lean Startup” methodology is one of the State-of-the-Art methodologies
for building successful companies at the current stage.
But, it is no silver bullet, and if you are not careful, it can hurt you.
Badly. Painfully. In this article, I tell you where I think a few of the
pitfalls are and I will give you my thoughts on what you can do to avoid the
pitfalls.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The Lean Startup methodology has two major building blocks:
The <strong>“Build/Measure/Learn”</strong> cycle, and the <strong>“Minimum Viable Product”</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, both of these concepts have major strengths, this is why the “Lean
Startup Methodolgy” was so successful. But they both have major
weaknesses. Here’s why:</p>

<h3 id="mvp--buildmeasurelearn-considered-harmful">MVP &amp; Build/Measure/Learn considered harmful</h3>
<p>The Build/Measure/Learn cycle is part of Lean Startup to address the problem
that “we cannot know everything in advance”. I agree that the problem
exists. Especially at the beginning of a new business.</p>

<p>This is why the methodology suggests to “build an MVP, show the customer, learn
from the data”. If the unexperienced starting Entrepreneur now follows the
receipe, the will naturally this “OK, the method says I have to build an
MVP, so let’s go and build an MVP.”</p>

<h3 id="first-doubts-regarding-the-methodology">First doubts regarding the methodology</h3>

<p>When I had a discussion with an experienced professional in the retail industry,
he said: “Look, Sebastian, I’ve not read the book ‘Lean Startup’. But I find it
hard to believe that the book does not talk about ‘research’ at all.”</p>

<p>So I went back and double checked. And: No, there’s no notion of research in
Eric Ries’ book “Lean Startup”. It even explicitly makes a case against it:</p>

<p>“<em>If Zappos had relied on existing market research, it could have asked what
customers thought they wanted. By building a product instead the company learned
much more…</em>”</p>

<p>So, in a nutshell, Entrepreneurs are explicitly advised to build instead of
doing research.</p>

<h3 id="a-first-effort-to-mitigate-this-problem">A first effort to mitigate this problem</h3>

<p>Steve Blank, one of the “founding fathers” of the Lean Startup methodology also
has written against this focus on “building in his post <a href="“https://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/”">“Why Build, Measure, Learn – isn’t just throwing things against the wall to see if they work – the Minimal Viable Product”</a>: In his post, he acknowledes that the focus on
“build” and “ideas” is leading into the wrong direction. He suggests to
focus on “hypotheses” and “experiments” about the “Business Model” instead.
He goes on mention the <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> as a solution.</p>

<h3 id="business-model-canvas-considered-harmful">Business Model Canvas considered harmful</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas"><strong>Business Model Canvas</strong></a> was
co-created by Alexander Osterwalder.  It’s main value lies in having
the “business model” on one page. For this, it has 9 sections
that relect core aspects of any business.</p>

<p>It also has reached widespread adoption, because of it’s ability to “reduce”
long business plan documents to their essentials and thus facilitate a better
discussion.</p>

<p>Other people have called the Business Model Canvas the <a href="&quot;https://www.alexandercowan.com/business-model-canvas-templates/#What_if_I_want_more_structure_to_work_through_this"><strong>“20 minute business
plan”</strong></a>.</p>

<p>So, it’s possible to fill Business Model Canvas created in 20 minutes. And
that’s what’s encouraged in most of the courses I’ve seen: You are asked
to create a “complete” canvas.</p>

<p>Sure, no problem, it only takes 20 minutes. After discussing a couple of
canvases with a coach, you will also get “good” at filling them: they
will not have any “obvious” contradictions any more.</p>

<p>You Business Model now “works” (in theory). But the problem is: The
content on the Canvas still is from “Guessland”.</p>

<p>And if you follow the methodology, your job now is to “build”. But: Have you
reduced the “risk”? No, probably not.</p>

<p>What happens if you build a product now? Your likelihood of “missing” the
customer needs are high.</p>

<p>Some people have suggested “improved versions” of the canvas - for example
Ash Maurya with his “Lean Canvas”. It
even claims to be “<a href="https://leanstack.com/leancanvas">optimized for Lean Startup</a>”.</p>

<p>But it has the same fundamental weaknesses: While it shows
“all the important things of a business at a glance”, and can be created
in “less than 20 minutes”, the Canvas at the same time
does not help you to <strong>“de-risk”</strong> your major risks.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-getting-out-of-the-building-and-customer-interviews">What about “Getting out of the building” and “Customer Interviews”</h3>

<p>To be fair, other thought leaders in the “Lean Startup” ecosphere have talked
about “research”.</p>

<p>In his book “The Startup Owners Manual”, Steve Blank explicitely talks about
“getting out of the building” and doing “customer discovery”.</p>

<p>Ash Maurya even has an “interview script” that he offers entrepreneurs as
a helpful guide to talk to the customer before “building”.</p>

<p>But: The “customer interview” approach is also problematic,
because interviews are scary for many people and hard to do “correctly”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you may end up hearing what you want to hear (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect">“Observer
      Expectancy Effect”</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the pure fact that you are interviewing can change the behaviour of
  the interview partners (an effect well known in Social Sciences called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">“Hawthorne effect”</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I agree, this is better then “building an MVP” without any customer interaction.</p>

<p>But: One of the main observations of this approach is: it is still very costly.
Ash Maurya suggests to plan about 3 months (calendar) time for
doing Customer Interviews, with ideally two people at the interview, albeit
part time.</p>

<p>There are three major problems with this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It still is a major investment. 3 months, two people, 50 interviews. If you
assume 3 hours per interview (1 hr commute, 1 hr interview, 1 hr documentation),
thats already 2 people x 50 interviews x 3 hours = 300 hours = 37,5 work day
equivalents + 2,5 days preparation &amp; sythesis x 500 USD per day = 20k USD. Ouch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It limits the “feedback loop cycle time” to about 3 months. Ouch again. That’s
long, especially if you remind yourself: Your assumptions are probably wrong
anyway, because you were guessing when you filled out the Canvas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do you do after you have falsified your initial assumptions?  Given
the likelihood your assumptions are wrong, that’s the major question.
My observation is: if people are lucky, they discover a problem worth solving
on the way and start focusing on that problem - that’s the group that might
become “successful”, if they get the a lot of things right.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If I look at it that way, it does not make much sense to me: What
good is a method that creates a false sense of reliability, that costs me
3 months, at least 20k USD, and still hinges on “luck” to find something
that might work on the way?</p>

<h3 id="that-was-a-lot---what-are-the-4-things-i-need-to-remember">That was a lot - what are the 4 things I need to remember?</h3>

<p>Here’s the summary of my observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lean Startup has a strong bias towards “building” an MVP very early
 in the process. But “building” is expensive, both in terms of (calendar)
 time-to-learning, as well as money and opportunity cost (cost-per-learning).</li>
  <li>The suggested “remedy” of using the Business Model Canvas may help to
 remove the obvious logic flaws in the business modell - but you
 are still largely “guessing”. Starting to “build” on that foundation is
 still as expensive</li>
  <li>The augmentation of Lean Startup with “customer interviews” has reduced
 monetary cost (somewhat), but is still “expensive” regarding (calendar)
 “time-to-learning”</li>
  <li>The success probability of the approach still “hinges” largely on
 gut feeling of the Entrepreneur and a component of “luck” and “finding” a
 problem worth solving for the customers.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ok-what-should-i-do">OK, what should I do?</h3>

<p>That’s a great question. My advise is: instead of focusing on “building an MVP”
ask yourself “What is the fastest way to achieve the learning I am looking for?”.
You can learn a lot about your (potential) clients through desk research. use
those opportunities. And then, as a next step, start “building”.</p>

<p>During the next weeks and months, I am going to work on a framework
that provides a more structured approach to that question. I am going to
focus on the major KPIs of “time-to-learning” and “cost-per-learning”.</p>
