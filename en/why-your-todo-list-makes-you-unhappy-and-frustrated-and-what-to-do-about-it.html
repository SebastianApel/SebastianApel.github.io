<h3 id="conventional-wisdom-takes-todo-lists-for-granted">Conventional wisdom takes todo-lists for granted</h3>

<p>This article is part of a series of articles on “Self Management” on the
intersection of “Happyness &amp; Productivity”.</p>

<p>Todo-Lists have been with me for most of my professional life. I have taken them
for granted. I have believed “that’s how professionals &amp; high achievers do it”.
(Oh, yes, and keeping all the stuff I want to do in my
head does not work either. So, writing it down is the way to go, right?)</p>

<p>And this was reinforced by “conventional wisdom”. Blogs write about todo-lists.
There are apps who help you to “digitize” your todo-list. So who am I to doubt
the mighty wisdom of the todo-List? Apparently that’s what you need when
you want to achieve.</p>

<h3 id="the-todo-list-will-help-me-to-be-happy-right">The todo-list will help me to be happy, right?</h3>

<p>For me, the underlying (not really explicit) belief (or maybe it’s better to call
it “hope”) was: Once I have achieved, then I will be happy.</p>

<p>And the todo-list was supposed to help me do this.</p>

<p>But happy did not come. Instead, unhappy &amp; frustrated &amp; overwhelmed came.</p>

<p>But: It cannot be the todo-list, right? It must be myself who is doing it
wrong… I’m not achieving enough. No wonder I’m not happy.</p>

<p>That’s what I believed for a long time…</p>

<h3 id="looking-more-closely">Looking more closely</h3>

<p>I don’t know where the courage came from, but recently I find myself looking
at things I have taken “for granted” in a new way.</p>

<p>So, I started to observe, and I realized the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the end of the day, I often was unhappy and felt I did not make any progress. Especially if I looked at all the stuff that I did not manage to get into the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>And another observation was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I tick item “off” my todo list, then I automatically have to look at all the items that are NOT ticked yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="trying-something-else">Trying something else</h3>

<p>So, I have decided to do something else at the end of each day:</p>

<p>I am now writing an entry into my “Achievement and Reflection” journal
(basically a text document that I add to at the end).</p>

<p>I reflect on the following four questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What did I create and/or ship and/or achieve today?</li>
  <li>What did I learn today?</li>
  <li>What do I want to repeat in the future?</li>
  <li>What do I want to do differently in the future?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="am-amazing-improvement">Am amazing improvement</h3>

<p>To me, this has made a huge difference. I can now look at the day more objectively and go home happy :-)  This then helps me to rest and relax better, which in turn improves my happiness and effectiveness the next day…</p>

<p>The hardest part for me was to establish the habbit - and I will go more
into details in another post.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-want-to-read-more">Do you want to read more?</h3>

<p>This article is based on insights I had during my current project. That project
focusses on developing a coaching program that helps people to become more
“Happy &amp; Productive”. You can find more information on the coaching
program <a href="http://blog.happy-and-productive.com/lp/happy-and-productive-coaching.html">here.</a></p>

<p>I am also going to write more articles on the topic. If you want to get
