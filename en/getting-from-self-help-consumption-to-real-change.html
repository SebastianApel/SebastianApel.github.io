    <p>Recently, I read a post on reddit where somebody was saying: “Hey, I feel like I am a self help addict - I consume a lot of information from podcasts, blogs, (audio) books, but when it comes to implementation, then I either do not start in the first place, or I stop again soon after starting”.</p>

<p>Since this person was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, I could say: Yes, totally. I have consumed a lot of self help content, too. And I too got frustrated because I realized: I only translated a very limited amount of the information that I consumed into action. I also had the experience, that I would execute some things for a certain time, but then I quit those things again. The person was also talking about wanting to quit meditation… And I could relate to the meditation example: Been there, done that, too.</p>

<p>I am currently experimenting with the following things (and I am actually quite happy with it currently):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mindset change: Reading Carol Dweck’s “Mindset” was actually an eyeopener for me: Before reading the book, I would have told you: “I sure have a growth mindset.” While reading the book, I realized: That’s not true, because I actually avoid the feeling of “I cannot do it (yet)”. And since this feeling is inherent in any kind of new behavior, it was blocking me from really doing to hard stuff (or expecting it to come easy to me). I’ve tried to counter this by giving myself “permission to suck (at least for a while)”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit formation: I try to set up “habits” to automate behavior I want to establish. The “tiny habits” approach was very helpful for me, I written about why in <a href="http://bit.ly/2scpcrm">this post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journaling: I’ve created a “journal template” for myself, basically a set of questions that I answer. The questions remind me of the “tiny habits” I am trying to establish, and they guide me through the thought process I wanted to use to reflect on the last 24 hrs, including what was good and what do I want do do differently in the next 24 hrs. After setting up the tiny habit of sitting down every morning [of each workday], I have been using this template for about 4 weeks now. It’s a lot easier for me to journal this way, because it “guides” me in areas where I have not yet set up the habits that I would like to have.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Especially the journaling habits is very helpful, because I recently started to ask myself a question from my journal template <strong>automatically</strong>. Which was an amazing feeling. Because it made me realize: I can change.</p>

<p>I am curious if you have been at this place, too - and what has worked for you.</p>
