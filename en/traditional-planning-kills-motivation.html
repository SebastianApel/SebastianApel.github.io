    <p>“Where’s your 90 day plan that you commit to?” I was asked yesterday.</p>

<p>OK, I had said that I am going to bring a plan.
But I did not. I did something else. Did not plan. I did not want to commit. But why?</p>

<p>Because, in the end, I did not want to feel like failure.</p>

<p>Because if I did not meet my goal, or plan, at the “committed upon” point in time - what would that mean?</p>

<p>While thinking about this, I realized that I hestitated because it was
totally unclear what I would commit to. So, I didn’t.</p>

<h3 id="and-i-think-i-am-right">And I think I am right</h3>

<p>Here’s why: I simply cannot “estimate” correctly when I am going to be “done”. First thing is: “Done” needs to be defined. Then: the question of “when are you going to reach ‘done’” depends on several factors that influence “time of completion”.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the factors from the top of my head. Let’s illustrate this by “laying a brick wall that is 1m high and 20m long”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(Estimated) amount of work: to reach “done”, a certain amount of work needs to be “worked”. The unit of work takes a certain amount of time. Let’s estimate 1m width of a brick wall 1m high takes 3 hours to complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Estimated) amount of “capacity to do work”: Well, if I have only 1hr during week days (because my day job is something else) and on the weekend I have 3,5hrs on both days, then I have a “capacity” of 5<em>1+2</em>3,5 = 12hrs per week. That’s 4m of brick wall per week, of 5 weeks for 20m of brick wall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And this is before unexpected stuff happens.</p>

<h3 id="but-unexpected-stuff-happens">But unexpected stuff happens</h3>

<p>The guy who is supposed to bring the bricks and mortar every week has a problem with the upstream delivery of mortar. Two weeks delay. My child gets sick, and therefore I cannot work on Friday and the weekend. Another week delay.</p>

<p>That’s 8 weeks instead of a 5 weeks. Great. And since I have committed to 5 weeks, my “accountability partner” (aka boss) will be asking: What’s happening? (”Are you not working hard enough?”, “Are you not good enough?”)</p>

<p>The list of “reasons” for the “delay” feels like an excuse. Even if I document every reason for a delay, the next round if discussion goes like (”Everybody knows that stuff happens - you should have planned for that in the first place” - and I hear “You are not good enough to plan”).</p>

<p>What makes the process even more complicated is the fact that I want to do stuff I have never done before. So, how good are my estimates going to be? Very likely: very far from reality. So, it’s even more likely that I am “off target”.</p>

<p><strong>More likely I have the “discussion”.</strong></p>

<p>Plus, what happens, if there is stuff on my list that I do not control? I.e. where there is not 100% probability of success? I do not know if the customer signs up. So, how can I commit to having 10 customers even I am not even sure if my offer is valuable enough so I get one person to buy?</p>

<p><strong>Even more likely to have “the discussion”.</strong></p>

<p>So, let’s try and look at it from a perspective of “what’s the stuff that I (directly) control?”</p>

<h3 id="time-my-own">Time (my own)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I can control the amount of time I invest (within limits, of course)</li>
  <li>In that time, I can control what I work on</li>
  <li>In that time, I can try to control how “focused” I work on the task</li>
  <li>In that time, I can try to control how “effectively” I work on the task</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I can “control” the amount of money I invest (within limits)</li>
  <li>I can control what I use the money for (until it’s gone)</li>
  <li>I can decide if I do it myself or if I get someone else to do it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resources-that-i-do-not-control-directly">Resources that I do not control directly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There also might be resources that are indirectly available to me. Those are mentioned in the book “A beautiful constraint” (chapter 5). But I am not going to go into detail here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-would-could-i-commit-to">So, would could I commit to?</h3>

<p>I could commit to the things that are under my direct control. That includes the time and the money I am going to invest.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>Once I commit to budget for time &amp; money, the next most important “lever” is the question of “what do I need/want to do next”?</p>

<p>At that stage, the best “input” is probably someone who has walked the path before.</p>

<p>Or that of other people who say: Why do you think you need that? What would happen, if you tried this instead of that? I think there might be a shortcut here - have you thought about that?</p>

<p>And that’s the discussion I want to have.</p>
