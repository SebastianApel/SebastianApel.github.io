  <div class="content has-text-black post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Are you an entrepreneur who is just starting? A blogger who wants to grow an email list? And are you asking yourself “Which is the best email list prodiver for me to use”?</p>

<p>I hear you. I’ve been there. My thought process was: I want to build an email list. Everybody successful has one. That’s why I need an email list provider, too. And, logically, I was asking myself “Which is the best email list prodiver for me to use?”</p>

<p>So I spent time researching the options, ended up testing Mailjet, not being happy with the outcome, researched more options, tested Sendy, not being happy with the fact that it did not let me know if the outbound emails were really sent, tested CleverReach where I was not happy with the fact that they have a Google ReCaptcha in the form. Tried to test Newsletter2Go, where they are still validating my company details at the time of writing, which means I could not even test their functionality as of yet.</p>

<p>After looking at my notes on the time it took me, I thing it took me about 10 hrs of work to get where I am now. And my outcome is qualitatively not where I want it to be, so I can choose to invest more time of live with the mediocre status quo. Frustrating. Really frustrating.</p>

<p>But: I’ve had an insight: I’ve been asking myself the wrong question. The right question is “Do I REALLY need an email list provider NOW?”</p>

<p>And my advice to you is: No, my friend, most likely not. I will probably need one. Later. But NOW, it’s very likely not required. I would even argue: It hurts you right now.</p>

<p>It hurts you, because</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will take you a lot of time to set the provider up (think 8+ hours)</li>
  <li>You will most likely not be happy with the result (I was not with mine)</li>
  <li>This will then frustrate you (I know I was)</li>
  <li>Which will raise the likelihood of you saying “WTF - this Entrepreneurship-Thing is not for me”.</li>
  <li>And on top, it takes away a great opportunity: The 1st hand experience of interacting with your potential customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestion to you is: Do not use an email list provider. Implement something similar to my setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Have a signup form sends an email to yourself along the lines “Hi Sebastian, would you please add me to your email list?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the person to an email list in your email client</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a freshly created email back to the person, thanking them for their interest, and start a conversation with them… Tell them “this is not a robot, it’s a real human”. Ask them what their biggest struggle is.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
