<h4 id="becoming-an-entrepreneur-is-dangerous-for-your-mental-health">Becoming an Entrepreneur is dangerous for your mental health</h4>

<p>A significant number of people have the dream to become an Entrepreneur.
Some of the dreamers embark on that journey. But: only very few make it.
So far, so known.</p>

<p>Less known, but even more alarming is that a larger amout of Entrepreneurs
seem to hurt themselves
on the journey.  Chris Myers has written on Forbes, that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/01/17/three-things-every-entrepreneur-needs-to-remember-when-dealing-with-depression/#3de5afa0366c">30% of Entrepreuners
are suffering from depression, while only 7% of the general population has that problem</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been asking myself: why is that the case?</p>

<h4 id="psychology-to-the-rescue">Psychology to the rescue</h4>

<p>When I look at this through the lens of Martin Seligmann’s theory of <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/learned-helplessness-seligman-theory-depression-cure/">“Depression and Learned
Helplessness”</a>, the model states that a person will develop depression[2], when</p>

<ol>
  <li>the person believes that the desired outcomes are improbable,</li>
  <li>or he/she believes that an undesired outcome is probable,</li>
  <li>and the person believes that she cannot do anything to change that</li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome to Entrepreneurship. I can understand every Entrepreneur who get’s the
feeling of “I can’t reach my desired outcome” after pouring heart and soul
into a project that does not take off.</p>

<h4 id="carol-dweck-again">Carol Dweck, again</h4>

<p>It get’s even more interesting when you look at Carol Dweck’s 1975 study “The
role of expectations and attributions in the alleviation of learned
helplessness”[3].</p>

<p>In a nutshell, she had participants work on problems. Some of the participants
were allowed to “always be successful” by lowering the standard below their
level of performance (SO=Success Only).
Others were exposed to “failure” by setting the bar above
their performance <em>on purpose</em>. In addition to communicating the failure,
the researchers also offered an explanation to the participants: “You should
have tried harder.” (AR=Attribution Retraining).</p>

<p>Then, during a test phase, the subjects were exposed to a “real” test scenario.
In the “real” test scenario, both groups got the same procedure. The procedure
contained  “preplanned” failure scenario.</p>

<p>And (not really surprising): Those subjects in the AR group who had “practiced”
failure where able to deal with the failure scenario and improve their performance.
The group that was only used to be “successful” could not handle failure very
well.</p>

<h4 id="interesting-but-what-does-this-have-to-do-with-learning-entrepreneurship">Interesting, but what does this have to do with learning Entrepreneurship?</h4>

<p>Well, if your are used to be successful in whatever you have done before: Brace
for impact. On the road to Entrepreneurship, stuff will not work as you want
it to. And if you are not used to that, the fact that something is not working
according to plan will have a detrimental effect on your performance. Not really
a “virtuous circle”.</p>

<p>I find the following mindshift tremendously important:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Try to build your self esteem around “showing up”, “trying” and “learning”.
A good sentence for that might be “I am the kind of person that …”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check if curiosity helps: A sentence like “I wonder what happens if I try X”
can do wonders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Practice” failure every day: Do hard stuff that you can not yet do - and
train yourself to deal with the thoughts and emotions that come up then.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How are you preparing yourself for the journey? Send me an email, I’m curious.</p>
